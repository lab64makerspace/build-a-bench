# Hand Tools

This is where we list hand tools and take the blame...

You'll find that the tools you like are going to depend on -

*What you work on and how often

*Your work style

and to some extent,

*Your budget

With the caution that I spend most of my bench time doing electro-mechanical assembly and board-level debug, here is a list of stuff that I find useful to have on my bench -

Scissors, kind used for sewing - I use them to cut copper tape, Kapton tape, etc. I clean them with isopropanol occasionally.

Scissors, small pointy kind - I use them for shaping copper tape, Kapton tape, etc.

Tweezers (oh, we could write a BOOK about tweezers) - maybe I'll write more about these later

"Xactoâ„¢" knife set - perhaps the MOST useful thing on the bench for hand work. I use these for removing the outer insulation from various double insulated wire styles and cables (e.g., the outer insulation of coax cable, the outer insulation of thermocouple wire, etc.)

Whetstone - a small one to keep the blades sharp

Diamond hone set - very helpful when you need it but I use it relatively rarely

Set of "jeweler's" files - VERY useful when you need them. I use them mostly for deburring things and for smoothing metal edges that might come into contact with wire insulation.

Small "needlenose" pliers - SUPER useful! I have two types, both small for bending wires, etc. One pair has "flat" jaws and the other has "round" jaws (they look like rods). They are both useful, and you can avoid nicking things with the round jawed ones.

"Reversible" 4-bit screwdriver - this has a #2 Phillips and a larger Phillips and, when you turn the shaft around, it has a small straight blade and a larger staight blade. I get a LOT of stuff done with this type of screwdriver!

Small wire cutters - Essential, but a constant source of frustration. I have several pairs and even though I treat them well, they always seem to be just a little out of sorts... sometimes the cutting blades are nicked, sometimes they don't meet properly. If you buy yours at a store, look at them carefully, you should NOT be able to see light pass between the blades. If you can, they aren't meeting properly, so don't buy that pair. DON'T CUT THICK WIRE WITH THESE!! They are meant for small diameter wire and for trimming through-hole component leads after soldering. GET THE BIG ONES FOR HEAVIER WORK!!
