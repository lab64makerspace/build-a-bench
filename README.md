How to build an electronics workspace tailored to *your* needs

This is a collection of thoughts on how to build *your* bench. There are certain things that most electronics benches will have in common, but often, *your* bench will be an expression of your creativity and the type of work you are doing at that time.

Since the lab64 user community is composed primarily of students and researchers, we will try to provide information useful for setting up a bench in limited space and with a limited budget.

The good news is that a lot of equipment has become more and more affordable, so a really quite capable bench may be had for a relatively miminal investment. On the other hand, buying "cheap" stuff can be a waste of money and, even worse, a waste of your *time*! So don't buy cheap stuff!

It has been said that "It is a poor craftsmen that blames his tools"! This has always been the case and so our call to you is to "Use your brain instead of your pocketbook". If one is truely a "maker / engineer" one can create their own tools! There is a truly FINE tradition of folks doing excellent work and pushing technology to places beyond what some thought was possible. Professor Tom Lee points out that the folks at Tektronix (the 'scope people) were able to get ~ 3x the performance from the same parts that their customers were using because they *UNDERSTOOD* what they were doing! So don't be discouraged, be *curious*!!

So without further ado, let's get started on *your* bench...

### Where to start
Well, it seems that it is difficult to have a bench without the "bench" part! So let's start there -

__*YOUR* BENCH__

Often folks don't have the luxury of dedicating space to a flat surface that is just for electronics work. It is more likely that you can only spare part of your desk to work on things and that you may actually need to "put things away" when you're not actively working on a project.

Well, again, good news!! This is entirely possible and, in fact, most of us spend a lot of time working on a small surface (about the size of a A4 size sheet).

I'm going to stop here... let's continue the discussion on the [BENCH](../bench) pages.
