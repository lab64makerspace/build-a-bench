# Soldering

Soldering is a very useful skill for working with electrical and electronic systems. We have tried to provide some [useful material](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/soldering-internal/learning) to help you get started. 

### Some basic equipment

When lab64 is open, you can use soldering equipment in the lab to work on your projects but what are the options when you want to do some soldering and the lab isn't available?

There are lots of places to buy soldering irons! They range in price from less than USD $5 to hundreds of dollars. We have looked around and located an entry level soldering iron that might suit your needs. It isn't the cheapest, but we believe it provides reasonably good value. You can purchase it from a variety of vendors; we just happened to find it at Jameco Electronics in Belmont, CA. It is their product number [2196801](https://www.jameco.com/shop/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&langId=-1&storeId=10001&productId=2196801) and retails at USD $ 24.49

If you are new to soldering, you may want to order an extra soldering iron tip, in case the tip you are using gets oxidized or damaged. These are not expensive and you can select from a couple different styles, the [0.5 mm conical tip](https://www.jameco.com/z/BITS5-Velleman-0-5mm-Conical-Tip-for-VTSS5-VTSS4NU-VTSS7U-Soldering-Stations_2174864.html?CID=MERCH) (like the one that comes with the iron) or a [3 mm "flat" tip](https://www.jameco.com/z/BITS5C-1-Velleman-3mm-Flat-Tip-for-VTSS5-VTSS4NU-and-VTSS7U-Soldering-Stations_2275071.html?CID=MERCH) sold as Jameco P/N 2275071.

You may also need some solder. We have been using lead-free solder successfully for some time now. We use a very common type know as SAC305 and is 96.5% Tin (Sn) : 3% Silver (Ag) : 0.5% Copper (Cu). SAC305 can be purchased in all sorts of quantities, but we find the small "pocket paks" to be convenient and minimize waste. The ones we buy are manufacturered by [Kester](https://www.kester.com) with Kester part number 83-7068-1402. They are not available directly from Kester but can be purchased through [NTE Electronics](https//:www.nteinc.com/kester-solder-products.php). We buy most of our supply from Jameco Electronics as [Jameco P/N 2113172](https://www.jameco.com/shop/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&langId=-1&storeId=10001&productId=2113172). This product is a "wire" solder and has a hollow core filled with flux, so you probably don't need to buy flux seperately.

You will also need to wear safety eyewear when soldering!!
